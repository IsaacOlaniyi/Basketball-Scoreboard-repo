## Overview
This project is a basketball scoreboard which can be used during a game of basketball as a counter to tally up the points of both sides/teams. You can add up to three points, as a normal game of basketball permits one point, two points, and three points. I really enjoyed bringing this project to life, it took me about a week to finish this project I learnt alot while building this basketball scoreboard and would love if you take a look and review my code and give me feedback on it.
